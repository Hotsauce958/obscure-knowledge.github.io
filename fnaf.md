Pre Afton Era


It all started in 1930, during the Great Depression. A little kid named William Afton saw a poster for a dancing bear. He saw this and wanted to inspire people. In 1970, William made a diner. They had suits people could wear. Eventually, a competing restaurant opened and put William out of business. The other diner owner is called Henry.


	(1980) This made William mad. But when Henry helped William get back on his feet, they opened a restaurant together, which was called Fredbear’s family diner. Everything was good, everyone came in to watch and have fun. It wasn’t until 1983 that catastrophe struck. William’s two sons, Michael and Chris were at Fredbear’s. Michael was a bully to Chris, and on his birthday, he shoved Chris in Fredbear's mouth, while he was crying. This causes the spring locks to shut on him and his skull.


	Spring locks are a mechanism that allows the costume to go into human suit function and robot function. Fredbear was in human suit function, the default is a robot. You can only have it in that mode for an amount of time before it switches to default. Some things that cause them to shut are moisture, water, liquids, and too much moving in the suits. Chris crying forced the spring locks to lock and go to the robot. 


	The spring locks shut on Chris' skull and crushed it. He was put into a coma and died. But before he died, he had many nightmares about each animatronic. Bonnie, Chica, Freddy, and Foxy were all a part of this. There were also two extra animatronics, Nightmare, and Nightmare Fredbear. They all tried to kill him, but he survived. William is left grieving over his dead son. They shut down the restaurant. 

















Freddy Era  


	In about 1985, they opened another restaurant called Freddy’s. It has animatronics that has facial recognition. Henry was both a partner and a form of jealousy for William. He found a way to make them even. He was jealous that Henry was better than him, so he wanted revenge. His son died at the hands of their creations, so William would make Henry pay.


	Henry has a daughter named Charlie. Some kids decided to lock her outside of the pizzeria. She would later go to the back, where William would be waiting, with a knife. He mercilessly kills her. He had no idea what to do with the body so he disposed of it with the trash. The animatronic The Puppet, which Henry built to protect Charlie, searches for her. 


	The Puppet finds her dying beside the trash. It was raining and her parts were damaged. She lays beside Charlie, causing her soul to be fused with The Puppet’s suit. Henry suspects William killed Charlie but has nothing to prove. William sees that he can kill more kids and put the blame on Henry, and he does that. 


	Five kids are missing, Gabriel, Fritz, Susie, Jeremy, and Cassidy. They all possessed the 5 animatronics Freddy, Bonnie, Chica, Foxy, and Golden Freddy or Fredbear. Chris also takes over Golden Freddy.


	With the kids dead, Freddy’s shut down. Henry knows that William killed the kids and kicked him out of business. William goes down his path. In about 1990, they opened another restaurant called Freddy Fazbear's Pizza. William wants to kill more kids, but facial recognition won’t let him. He has no choice but to use Spring Bonnie, an animatronic suit from Fredbears to get in. 


	He kills more kids, which puts Henry in a bad position. Michael Afton signed up for the night guard for Freddy’s. He survives just barely. William goes into the basement of his house and builds a lab down there. He uses the lab to experiment with remnants.






	Remnant is your soul but fused with something else. In this case, it’s the animatronics. William breaks into the old Freddy’s and dismantled the animatronics with the souls still in there. He heats the metal down, so it can be used for other projects. William creates child-killing animatronics to experiment with more remnants. They are called Funtime Freddy, Circus Baby, Funtime Foxy, and Ballora. 


	William designed Circus Baby after his daughter, Elizabeth. She listened. Until one day she didn’t. While William’s back was turned, she sneaked up to Circus Baby, and it scooped her body and shoved it inside her. This causes the soul to be fused with Circus Baby. With two of their children dead, William’s wife gets a divorce. William gets Michael to go back and save Elizabeth but is unsuccessful. 


	Michael gets into the scooping room, which scoops his insides out and allows Ennard and all of the animatronics to climb into him. He ends up walking out of there but later throws Ennard up and out of him. (1989)


	His wife and two children are dead. William kills more kids to help with his grieving. He gets back into the Spring Bonnie costume and goes to Freddy’s to kill more kids. The children’s spirits surround him. William gets worried because he can’t kill something already dead. He got back into the thing that killed them in the first place. But, the suit malfunctioned. He got spring locked. After what felt like hours of screaming and agony, William supposedly dies. He is stuck in the safe room for 30 years until Michael returns to end everything. Henry tells him that William is still in there, and wants him to go in there and end everything.


	Five days later, Michael burns the place down. (2023) Leaving Afton to burn. Michael runs out of there and everything “ends”. Three years later Henry discovers that there are still souls not at rest. He built one final restaurant to end everything. He lures every animatronic still alive and gets them into there. He burns everything and leaves a message for Michael.


	Scrap-baby- You played right into our hands. Did you think that this job just fell out of the sky for you? No, this was a gift. For us. You gathered them all, in one place. Just like he asked you to. All those little souls in one place. Just for us, a gift. Now we can do what we were intended to do. And be complete. I will make you proud daddy. Watch, listen and be full.






	Henry Emily- Connection terminated. I’m sorry to interrupt you, Elizabeth. if you still even remember that name. But I’m afraid you’ve been misinformed. You are not here to receive a gift, nor have you been called here by the individual you assume. But you have indeed been called. You have all been called here. Into a labyrinth of sounds and smells, misdirection, and misfortune.


	A labyrinth with no exit. A maze with no prize. You don’t even realize you are trapped. Your blood lust has driven you in endless circles, chasing the cries of children in some unseen chamber. Always seeming so near, yet somehow out of reach. But you will never find them, none of you will. 


	And to you, my brave volunteer, who found this job listing, somewhat not intended for you. Although there was a way out planned for you, I have a feeling that’s not what you want. I have a feeling you’re right where you want to be. I am remaining as well. I am nearby. This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away as the agony of every tragedy should.


	And to you monsters trapped in the corridors, be still and give up your spirits. They don’t belong to you. For most of you, I believe there is peace, and perhaps warmth waiting for you after the smoke clears. Although for one of you, the darkest pit of hell has opened to swallow you whole, so don’t keep the devil waiting old friend.


	My daughter, if you can hear me, I knew you would return to me as well. It’s in your nature to protect the innocent. I’m sorry that on that day, the day you were shut out and left to die. No one was there to lift you into their arms, the way you lifted others into yours. And then, what became of you? I should’ve known you wouldn’t be content to disappear. Not my daughter, I couldn’t save you then, so let me save you now. It’s time to rest, for you and those you carried in your arms. This ends for all of us. End communication. Everyone and everything burns. Except for one person. Afton. The agony in which he felt, allowed him to survive.
	





	The Glitch Trap Virus


	A certain group of anonymous people inherits the Fazbear business. They find a few files containing William’s thoughts and whereabouts inside them. Of course, they don’t do a full search and make a game. A VR game to be specific. The unlucky soul by the name of Vannesa puts on the headset. 


	The files corrupt her brain,  causing her to fall to William Afton. She goes through 5 therapists. Killing each one of them. There are two sides to Vennesa, Vanny, and Vennesa. Vanny decides to build a giant mall on top of the burnt location, where William has been resting for the past 4 years.


	William has been staying silent inside a pod for a long time and puts himself into one last form. During one of the performances, Glam Rock Freddy Malfunctions. He puts himself in safety mode. This is caused by Afton. At about 6 AM, Gregory goes underground where the original FNAF 6 location is and faces off against Afton and the blob. The blob is Ennard in a later form.
	Gregory dodges the tentacles, the other animatronics, and Afton's grasp. Managed to set the place on fire one last time. Gregory sets the place on fire and runs out of there with Glamrock Freddy. Killing everyone and everything inside the Pizzaplex. Afton and Vennesa both die. This ends the entire Fazbear business, and everything else. 


	Gregory and Glamrock Freddy escape. Afton dies, Vanny dies, Ennard dies, and “This place will not be remembered, and the memory of everything that started this can finally begin to fade away, as the agony of every tragedy should.”


	Scott has made one of the best video game franchises and, a shame everyone hates him for being him. He is one of the best to exist and will be for a long time.
